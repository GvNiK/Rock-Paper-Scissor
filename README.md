# Rock-Paper-Scissor

 This is simple Turn based game of Rock,Paper and Sissors. When the Player selects any one element out of the three, the round behins and the AI chooses any one element randomly. An animation is played which provides buffer some time and then finally the elements are reveled. I implemented the comparison logic to compare which element defies the other by using the Rock, Paper, Sissor game rules. I used the If-else if statments to check the draw conditions.
